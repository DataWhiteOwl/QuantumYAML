########## Defining Long/Multi-line String in YAML ##########

##### First Approch - Pipe #####
### Pipe (|) ---> means preserve in YAML ###

literal_block: | # use - and + to subtract or retain space beween two string blocks
  This is literal block
  Newline are preserved
  So is indentation
  Trailing space are preserved as well

### Output - 
# literal_block:
# This is literal block
# Newline are preserved
# So is indentation
# Trailing space are preserved as well

##### Second Approch - Folded Block Style #####
### Folder Block Style (>) ---> Used to fold new line into spaces. This is used for text where you don't wanrt hard line appear in the output ###

folded_block: >  # use - and + to subtract or retain space beween two string blocks
  This is folded block.
  Newline are preserved.
  So is indentation.
  Trailing space are preserved as well.

### Output - 
# folded_block:
# This is folded block. Newline are preserved. So is indentation. Trailing space are preserved as well.


###### Date and TimeStamp in YAML
# Standard Data Format : YYYY-MM-DD ---> 2034-07-23

# Full Data & Time Format (Canonical) : YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
# T - separates the date and time
# Z - indicate UTC time
# Example - 2034-07-23T10:20:30Z

# Full Data & Time with Timezone (iso8601) : 
# YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM
# YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-HH:MM
# Example - 2034-07-23T10:20:30+05:30

# Others Examples - 2034-07-23 10:20:30 +05:30
# Others Examples - 2034-07-23 10:20:30
